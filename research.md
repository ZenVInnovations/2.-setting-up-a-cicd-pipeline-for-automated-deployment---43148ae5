 Phase 1: Research on CI/CD and GitHub Actions

Prepared by: BHAVYASHREE M

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for *Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment*. It is a method used in software development to automate the process of:
- Testing code automatically after every change (CI)
- Deploying code to production or staging environments automatically (CD)

CI/CD ensures faster and more reliable delivery of code.

## What is GitHub Actions?

*GitHub Actions* is a built-in CI/CD tool in GitHub that allows us to automate workflows like:
- Running tests
- Building the project
- Deploying code

It uses .yml files to define workflows, and they can be triggered on events like code pushes or pull requests.

## Tools Used in CI/CD:

Here are some commonly used CI/CD tools:
- *GitHub Actions* – For automation in GitHub
- *Docker* – For containerizing applications
- *Netlify / Vercel* – For deploying frontend projects
- *Jenkins* – An open-source automation server
- *Heroku* – Easy cloud app deployment

## Why We Are Using GitHub Actions

- It is directly integrated with GitHub
- Easy to set up and use for small to medium projects
- No need to use external CI/CD platforms
- Helps track progress through workflows

Next Steps: Use GitHub Actions to create automated workflows for building, testing, and deploying.
